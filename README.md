# NEAT
An artificial intelligence based on the NEAT algorithm. It uses the natural laws of survival of the fittest to choose the optimal genes for each individual in a specie. And to get rid of the individuals who are not good enough.

## Running the program
To run the program simply run the main.py file.

Bear in mind this project is not finished yet, but it works, just not optimally.
